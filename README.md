# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
This first project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores. 

We start with Part1 outlines the flow of the project. Then for Part2, we load the data, present the initial information about the data and proceed with cleaning. Part 2 ends with saving the cleaned data for future reference.

For Part 3, we being exploring data analysis through visualizations to help understand, explain or model the sales data.

I have included the following visuals to guide the next steps of this project:

The regplot above shows the positive relationship of the items' maximum retail price and outlet sales. As the maximum retail price goes up, the outlet sales increase as well. It would be interesting to check and confirm for this data if higher prices and high sales volume will help sales prediction.

This scatterplot, with additional information for the graph above, gives us an indication that the data might help us explain the positive, moderate correlation of item MRP and outlet sales by also looking at the location type of an outlet or tier type in predicting sales for food items at various stores.
